# Password generator

## Description: 
THis password generator is written in python. It's the starting point to put my python knowledge to the test.
Many more features will be added in future versions.

## How to use: 
No specific installation requirements with the initial version apart from pyperclip.
So the following packages are required for this script to work.
- pyperclip

You can add pyperclip with :

``` pip install pyperclip ```

## Technologies: 
More on that soon with adjunction of webframework and GUI.

## Collaborators: 
I'm doing that on my own. Any comments or suggestions welcome
